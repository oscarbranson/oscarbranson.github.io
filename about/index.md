## Who is Oscar?
I am Oscar. I am a scuba-diving farmer from Wales who got interested in how the world works, got stuck at university, and ended up studying plankton shells in California. If you want the nitty-gritty, [have a look at my CV](/assets/140928_FullCV.pdf).

## How did this happen?

I grew up on a farm in South Wales. I went to a [Steiner school](http://www.steineracademyhereford.eu/), where I first worked out that I liked learning things. I spent my summers in the Scilly Isles, where I fell in love with the sea.

At 16 I went to [St. Clare's, Oxford](http://www.stclares.ac.uk/) to do the [International Baccalaureate](http://www.ibo.org/). Mainly because I didn't know what I wanted to do, and the IB forces you to stay broad. I studied Biology, English, Geography, Spanish, Music and Maths. Clearly had no idea where I was going.

Biology caught my interest, and I decided to go to
<!-- <img style="position:absolute; LEFT:800px" src="/images/bristol_logo.png" width="60"> -->
[Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/biology/)... but not before a [Gap Yah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKFjWR7X5dU). I had an exciting gap year: working 4 part time jobs while doing a chemistry A level at the local comprehensive. And then I went to Borneo with [Raleigh International](http://raleighinternational.org/). Essentially, an excude for a lot of middle class yoof to feel benevolent while having a lot of fun; 'helping' the locals do things they could have done better in half the time. But it was great fun, I learnt to travel and I learnt to dive.

After an eventful 3 years in Bristol, I graduated and moved on to the next shiny topic that had caught my eye:
<!-- <img style="position:absolute; LEFT:800px" src="/images/noc_logo.jpg" width="60"> -->
[Oceanography](http://noc.ac.uk/). I moved away from genetics, physiology and ant behaviour, out onto the abyssal plains, finding out how little we know about how our planet works.

From here, there was only one direction: geochemistry. Learning how to read the planet. Working out how our world has evolved by studying subtle patterns in structure and chemistry. A wonderfully complex field encompassing biology, chemistry, physics and history.

This fascination took me to [Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/) to do a PhD in [Earth Sciences](http://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/) under the guidance of palaeoceanographer [Harry Elderfield](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/people/academic-staff/harry-elderfield), and mineraolgist [Simon Redfern](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/people/academic-staff/simon-redfern).

I spent a lot of my time in Cambridge all over the world, lost down X-ray microscopes, surrounded by humming machines in rooms with no windows. All to work out how plankton make their shells. I also met some extremely excellent people, and got involved in quite a lot of [Rowing](http://jcbc.jesus.cam.ac.uk/).

After nearly four years in Cambridge, I made a big leap: to California. At the moment, I'm doing a Postdoc split between [Earth and Planetary Sciences at UC Davis](http://geology.ucdavis.edu/index.php) and the [Oceanography at the University of Washington](http://www.ocean.washington.edu/), under the guidance of Profs [Howie Spero](http://geology.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/spero.php) and

[Alex Gagnon](http://www.ocean.washington.edu/home/Alex+Gagnon).

So far, America has been fun.
