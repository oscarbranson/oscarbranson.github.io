I am a scuba-diving farmer from Wales who got stuck at university, and ended up studying plankton shells. At the moment, I do this in Australia.

If you want the nitty-gritty, [**have a look at my CV**](/assets/140928_FullCV.pdf).

#### My Story

I grew up on a farm in South Wales. I went to a [Steiner school](http://www.steineracademyhereford.eu/), where I worked out that I liked learning. I spent my summers in the Scilly Isles, where I fell in love with the sea.

At 16 I went to [St. Clare's, Oxford](http://www.stclares.ac.uk/) to do the [International Baccalaureate](http://www.ibo.org/). This is where I got interested in Biology.

Biology led me to [Bristol University](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/biology/), but not before a [Gap Yah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKFjWR7X5dU). I had an exciting gap year, working 4 part time jobs while doing a chemistry A level at the local comprehensive school... Then I took off for Borneo with [Raleigh International](http://raleighinternational.org/). Essentially, this was an excuse for a lot of middle class yoof to feel benevolent while having a lot of fun, 'helping' the locals do things they could have done better in half the time. I learnt to travel, and I learnt to dive.

After three years studying Biology, I moved on to [Oceanography](http://noc.ac.uk/). I left genetics, physiology and ant behaviour, and moved out onto the abyssal plains, to find out how little we know about how our planet works.

From here, it was a natural progression to geochemistry, learning how to read the chemical patterns that biological and geological processes leave behind, to tell the story of how the world is put together. A wonderfully complex field encompassing biology, chemistry, physics and history.

Geochemistry took me to [Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/) to do a PhD in [Earth Sciences](http://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/) under the guidance of mineraolgist [Simon Redfern](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/people/academic-staff/simon-redfern) and palaeoceanographer [Harry Elderfield](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/people/academic-staff/harry-elderfield). I spent my PhD trying to work out how plankton (and other sea creatures) make their shells.

After nearly four years in Cambridge, I made a big leap to California, where I spent two years as a Postdoc split between [Earth and Planetary Sciences at UC Davis](http://geology.ucdavis.edu/index.php) and [Oceanography at the University of Washington](http://www.ocean.washington.edu/), under the guidance of Profs [Howie Spero](http://geology.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/spero.php) and [Alex Gagnon](http://www.ocean.washington.edu/home/Alex+Gagnon).

Now, I'm at the [Research School of Earth Sciences](http://rses.anu.edu.au/) at the [Australian National University](http://www.anu.edu.au/) in Canberra.
