This ant has been completely taken over by a fungus. It's dead now, but the fungus has been in control for some time.

The fungus (*Ophiocordyceps unilateralis*) has a complex relationship with the carpenter ant (*Camponotus leonardi*). Yeast-like spores of the fungus attach to live ants, and gradually work their way into the body. Once there, they manipulate the chemistry of the ant's nervous system, and change its behaviour. At this stage the ant is effectively a zombie, and all its actions benefit its fungal invader.

The zombie ant climbs up plants, and sinks its mandibles into the tick veins on the underside of leaves. Once attached, the fungus rapidly attacks the jaw muscles of the ant so it can't detach, leaving it dangling on the underside of the leaf. The fungus then changes mode, and kills the ant. It grows tendril-like hyphae through the ants body, bursting out of the exoskeleton and firmly anchoring the ant to the underside of the leaf.

The fungus then grows a large 'fruiting' structure, which grows through the back of the ant's head. The fruiting structure ripens, and scatters its spores on the ground below, where a new generation of zombie ants are infected.

This specific fungus-ant relationship is found in Thailand and Brazil, although numerous other examples of 'zombie insects' can be found throughout the world. Don't worry though - there aren't any human zombie fungi.
