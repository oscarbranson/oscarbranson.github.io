I study plankton. For fun, but also for my PhD.

The term plankton covers any animal or plant that lives in the ocean, and cannot control where they end up. The clue is in the name – planktos is Greek for ‘drifter’. This description isn’t particularly useful, and covers a truly mind-boggling diversity of sizes, shapes and lifestyles: from impossibly tiny micro-bacteria, to the enormous Lion’s Mane jellyfish, 2m in diameter, with tentacles longer than 3 buses!

Every drop of seawater is teeming with microscopic life, with its own complicated ecosystem of plants, grazers and predators all striving to survive. This microscopic tangle of life provides food for all the animals in the sea, and indirectly supports most life on land. They are an integral part of global nutrient cycling, cloud formation, regulating the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, and produce the oxygen in every second breath you take. In short, they are important!

In this strange, unexplored micro-world, it’s easy to get caught up in how little we understand, and just marvel at the fantastic creatures as they float by. But in science, this is frowned upon. We pick a detail of the complicated picture, and work away frantically: we hypothesise, and scheme, and reduce the detail to numbers. We categorise it, describe it, and seek to understand it, and so the puzzle is slowly completed. This does bring the inevitable frustration that as soon as you’ve completed your part of the jigsaw, you suddenly notice another smaller one inside it, or find that it doesn’t fit with someone else’s part… but this is all part of the fun, and it’s the curiosity that drives us.

My particular piece of the puzzle is shells. Yes. Plankton can make shells. Even the plants try their hand at sculpting minerals to their advantage, and produce some truly incredible and improbable structures. They make them predominantly from calcium carbonate, or silica. I study the former.

{% include image.html url="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Haeckel_Thalamphora.jpg" description="A collection of foraminifera, microscopic zooplankton that make intricate calcium carbonate shells. The largest of these shells is probably arouns 0.5 mm in diameter. A hand drawn plate from Ernst Haeckel’s 1904 ‘Kunstformen der Natur’." %}

Aside from their beauty, these shells are of surprising global importance. Despite their tiny size, they are present in such ubiquity and abundance that their growth, death and sinking has a profound effect on the global carbon system, and on the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. To put it into perspective, 99% of the White Cliffs of Dover are made up of prehistoric plankton shells, and you can see ‘blooms’ of these shell-forming critters from space.

Coccolithophores are tiny phytoplankton (plants) that produce microscopic calcium carbonate plates (see below). The water is appears pale because of the millions of tiny calcium carbonate shells reflecting sunlight back out of the surface." %}

The fundamental processes of shell formation are also very interesting. These tiny animals and plants sculpt relatively simple minerals into fantastically intricate designs, with mechanical properties that far exceed their raw components. People have been trying for years to understand and replicate these processes. Forget 3D printing – just think of being able to grow yourself a new hip! But sadly this is a long way off, and we are still struggling to get to basics with how animals manage to control their minerals so precisely.

The whole structure is approximately 1 micron long (1/1000th of a mm). These ‘liths’ make up most of the White Cliffs of Dover." %}

Finally, we are interested in these shells because of what they can tell us about the past. In large areas of the oceans, and parts of the land (White Cliffs), there are millions of years worth of mud and ooze, full of the shells of these plankton. Each of these tiny shells provides us with a snapshot of the world it lived in. We can learn a lot by looking at the size, appearance and disappearance of different types of shell through time, but the real revelations come when we look more closely at the chemical composition of the shells. They are made of almost pure calcium carbonate, but while they are growing traces of other chemicals find their way into the shells, and the concentrations and types of chemicals that get in there speaks volumes about the world the animals lived in. We can work out the temperature and pH of the ocean, we can estimate how much ice there was on the planet, we can get ideas about how productive (i.e. how much life) the ocean was at the time, we can track the movements of ocean currents, and we can begin to understand the way the world was before records began.

The chemicals in these shells give us a record of global climate that stretches back millions of years, and from this record we can try to work out how the world works. We can consider the coming and going of ice ages, think about what is important for climate stability, and climate change, attempt to understand what happens to the world then a meteor hits it, or all the volcanoes go off at once, and try to work out how our world fits together. But our understanding of all these big systems and fundamental ideas relies almost entirely on how much we can trust the chemical indicators in these shells. This is where I come in.

I look at how the shells form, and try to understand how the chemicals get in there, and how these mechanisms effect our interpretation of past events. Effectively, I test the tools that people use to understand out planet, and make sure they’re reliable. I’m a glorified (questionable) mechanic!

What does this mean day to day? It takes me to interesting places, doing peculiar things. Right now, I’m sitting in a synchrotron outside Berlin, surrounded by humming machines, tin foil, and not enough sleep! But more on all that later…
