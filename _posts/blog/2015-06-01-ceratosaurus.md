Ceratosaurus was a big, armoured predator.

| **Common Name**      | Ceratosaurus (Ceh-rah-to-saurus)                      |
| **Size**             | up to 6 m (20 ft) long               |
| **Age**              | Late Jurassic (153 â€“ 148 million years ago) |
| **Geographic Range** | North America, Europe, Africa                          |
| **Liked**            | Swimming?                                  |
| **Disliked**         | Larger predators                                       |
| **Taxonomy**         | Animalia > Chordata > Dinosauria > Theropoda > Ceratosauridae |

It had a disproportionately big head full of nasty, big slicing teeth, horns, and a row of bony plates along its back. The horns and plates probably weren't much good for protection, but along with the big, knife-like teeth, they made it look pretty bad-ass. The only thing that detracted from this fearsome demeanour was its tiny [T-Rex-style arms](http://goo.gl/A9dFt)... but you can't win them all.

It has been found on three separate continents, but was thought to have been relatively rare, at least compared to its larger relative, the Allosaurus. It had a long body, with a flattened crocodile-like tail, which suggests it may have had a semi-aquatic lifestyle. Ceratosaur fossils are often found close to the fossils of early fish, which supports this idea, but some palaeontologists think that it was the wrong shape for swimming, and it wouldn't be able to keep its head out of water.

Ceratosaurus was one of the first dinosaur film stars, appearing in the 1914 'Brute Force', alongside [scantily clad cave-women](https://goo.gl/Vea50R), and a mighty [Triceratops](https://goo.gl/4VI57x). Ceratosaurus appears briefly in Jurassic Park 3, [intent on turning the stars into a tasty afternoon snack](https://goo.gl/QA4jmA), but is scared off by some [Spinosaurus](https://goo.gl/9RTLFy) dung.
