This moderately sized herbivore makes an appearance in 'The Lost World'. Its distinctive domed head immediately earns it the nick-name 'Friar Tuck', when the big-game hunter Roland Tembo can't pronounce Pachysephalosaurus (can YOU?).

| **Common Name**      | *Pachycephalosaurus* (Pac-ee-seff-a-loh-sorus) |
| **Size**             | up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) long                |
| **Age**              | Late Cretaceous (72 - 66 million years ago)    |
| **Geographic Range** | North America                                  |
| **Liked**            | Eating plant                                   |
| **Disliked**         | Head-butting things                            |
| **Taxonomy**         | Animalia > Chordata > Dinosauria > Ornithischia > Pachycephalosauridae |

In the film, a particularly hairy palaeontologist treats us to a [description of this fine animal](https://goo.gl/b4PxAY){:target="_blank"}. It's a herbivore from the late Cretaceous, he tells us. So far, so good. He then points out its rounded head, with (up to) 9-inches of solid bone, and explains how its specially shaped neck allows it to line up its entire body behind its charging head. The pachycephalosaur then obligingly headbuts a bystander *through* a jeep. Nice try Jurassic Park, but a little off the mark... This head-butting theory was disproved in the late '70s, when palaeontologists realised that there was no way the skull was strong enough to withstand a full on collision. Their necks were also the wrong shape (J- or U-shaped, rather than straight) to be able to 'line up'. A pachycephalosaur running into a jeep would probably have led to a broken dinosaur.

We know it didn't run and [charge like a Musk Ox](http://goo.gl/DuMs0i){:target="_blank"}, so what's with the 'Friar Tuck' bald patch? Its clearly weaponised head would mainly have been used for settling disputes with other pachysephalosaurs, and defending itself from predators (like T-Rex, which was around in the same place at the same time!). We think it would have used its head like a club, swiping sideways into its challenger. Probably something similar to [what male Giraffes do to each other in the mating season](https://goo.gl/E9ony6){:target="_blank"}, but with a shorter neck .

When the first pachycephalosaurus skulls were found in the late 19th century, they were so bony that people thought they were the kneecaps of a larger dinosaur. Dinosaurs don't actually have kneecaps... but they didn't know that back then, so give them a break!
