##Goldschmidt 2013 – Monday##

###Session 19k: Life Below the Seafloor – How Alive, and How Important?###

[Steve D'Hondt](http://www.gso.uri.edu/dhondtlab/Welcome_to_the_DHondt_Lab.html) kicked the session off with a fantastic introduction to the ‘Mysteries of Subseafloor Sedimentary Life’, where he painted a bizarre picture of an alien and incredible world beneath the oceans. Until recently, we thought these depths were devoid of all life.

Light does not penetrate to the bottom of the ocean. Everything that lives there survives of detritus falling from the teeming waters far above them, or gets its energy from the frenetic chemical reactions at [hydrothermal vents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent), where volcanically heated water belches out of the seafloor at up to 400 degree celsius. Life at these depths is sparse, mostly microbial, and adapted to life in a cool, lightless world. This world is strange to us, but there are aspects of the familiar – fish, sharks, and crustaceans can all be found down here. Underneath these creatures, the world gets more peculiar.

A layer of marine mud several kilometres thick covers most of the sea floor. It reaches all the way down to the hard basement rock of the oceanic crust. This mud has built up over millions of years from a mixture of dead plants and animals from the surface waters, and runoff from continents sinking from the sea surface. This creatively-named ‘marine snow’ provides all the food for the organisms living deep beneath the surface.

At the surface, this marine mud is rich in food, oxygen and life and is a relative hive of activity. Microbes work away frantically digesting the food that has fallen from the surface. But as the marine snow continues to fall, these busy microbes start to get buried. Many die off as they run out of food, but a specialist few survive and take over as they are buried deeper and deeper. The deep muds are dominated by a diverse community of bacteria and archaea (archaea are a collection of evolutionarily ancient single-celled bugs that are often good at surviving in extreme conditions.)

As they go deeper, the muds become cooler, pressure increases, the amount of food decreases and everything starts to slow down. At these depths it’s hard to tell that anything is alive at all because they are living so slowly. The microbes here can take up to 10,000 years to double their population size (E. coli can do this in around 20 minutes!). Some have suggested that they can use energy from the slow decay of radioactive chemicals in the sediments, rather than relying solely on the small amounts of food in the mud. We only discovered that they were there by stumbling across their DNA. They are adapted to a world were there is very little food, and nothing changes in a hurry.

Go deeper still, and the temperature begins to rise – heat from beneath the thin oceanic crust penetrates up through the sediments, and increases the temperature to hundreds of degrees celcius. This limits the lower limits of where these barely-alive creatures can exist to between 2-5 km.

These microbes have a big influence on the chemistry of deep sediments, which can affect the role they play in global chemical cycles, and even the composition of volcanic eruptions. As oceanic crust is sucked down below the Earth’s surface, the layer of mud that the microbes live in goes with it, and the chemistry of this mud can influence the chemistry of the upper mantle, and therefore the nature of volcanic eruptions. In truth though, we really don’t know how important these deep microbes are to the surface world – we have only just realised that they exist!

The presence of these bizarre microbes stretches our definitions of life – they live and divide on geological timescales, far removed from the energy cycles driven by the sun at the surface. They raise interesting questions about the possibilities of life on other planets – if they can survive in the depths with almost no food or oxygen, who knows what could be hiding under the surface of Mars?
