Seaweed is practically a staple food in coastal East Asia, and you'll find it in restaurants and supermarkets across the globe. Today, 90% of it comes from seaweed farms. This image, captured by NASA's Landsat 8 satellite, shows seaweed farms off the coast of South Korea.

Each dark stripe or block is a 'field' of seaweed. These 'fields' consist of parallel rows of stakes connected by long ropes, with periodic shorter ropes hanging down towards the sea floor. Each one of these hanging ropes has seaweed growing from it. It's worth taking a look at the full resolution image, to see the extent of these seaweed farms - they cover an incredible area.

Seaweed farming, like all farming, causes a degree of environmental disruption, mostly from clearing mangrove swamps or existing sea-grass beds. However, these damaging practices are actively discouraged, as they reduce water quality, and damage the seaweed crop. In fact, seaweed farming is pretty good for the environment, as it goes. They don't require the use of fertilisers, they don't need a fresh water supply, and they provide valuable breeding grounds for all sorts of fish and invertebrates, which are good for the whole marine ecosystem. They can even be used to 'soak up' damaging excess nutrients from terrestrial farms which flow down rivers into the sea.

I think I'll have Sushi tonight...
