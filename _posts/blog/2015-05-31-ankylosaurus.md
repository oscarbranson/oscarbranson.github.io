This big, heavy herbivore is the archetypal armoured dinosaur. It is often compared to a tank.

| **Common Name**      | Ankylosaurus (An-kee-loh-saurus)                         |
| **Size**             | up to 6.25 m (20.5 ft), estimated 4 tonnes (8,800 lbs)                        |
| **Age**              | Late Cretaceous (68 â€“ 66 million years ago) |
| **Geographic Range** | North America                                  |
| **Liked**            | Armour                                       |
| **Disliked**         | Moving                                       |
| **Taxonomy**         | Animalia > Chordata > Dinosauria > Ornithischia > Ankylosauridae |

Its squat frame was covered in large, bony plates ('osteoderms'), arranged in regular patterns all over its back and tail. The osteoderms along the flanks of some species were spikes, as an extra deterrent. Inside, many of its bones were fused together, providing extra strength at the cost of mobility and grace. Ankylosaurus was a lumberer, not a runner, probably preferring to stand its ground and rely on its armour, rather than trying to escape. Its estimated top speed was just 6 mph.

Its head was broad and heavy, and looked a lot like the big, bony club on the end of its tail. The tendons that attached to the club-like tail were stiffened and partly ossified (bony) to increase the transfer of power from the tail muscles to the club - it had a serious tail-swipe, capable of shattering bones. For a while, scientists thought that the similar appearance of the head and the tail might have been to confuse predators, exposing them to a mighty tail-whack when they went for the wrong end. We now know that they don't look similar enough for this to be true... a nice idea, though.

Since its discovery in 1908, this dino-tank has been a regular in popular entertainment. Most notably, a model Ankylosaur appeared in the 1964 World's fair in New York, and in seven Godzilla films (as 'Anguirus') between 1955-2004. It also made a fleeting appearance in Jurassic Park III, and and it seems to be one to watch out for in Jurassic World.
