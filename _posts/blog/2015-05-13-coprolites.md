Yep. A poo. A fossil poo, to be precise. Or more technically, a coprolite.

Paleontology can tell us a lot about animals of the past. Fossil bones tell us what shape they were, fossil footprints tell us how they moved, fossil micro-structures and imprints can tell us about skin textures and give us clues about their physiology. But none of this really tells us how all these ancient beasts interacted, or how their ecosystem fitted together. The closest we get is tooth marks in fossil bones, which tell us a little about who ate who, but these types of marks are extremely rare, and only really tells us about the top predators in the food chain. What about the rest? The herbivores, omnivores, and things that preyed on small, delicate animals? The answer? Coprolites, of course.

Fossil poo contains everything the animal eats. Fragments of shells, small bones, leaves, even plankton in some marine filer-feeding beasts. This kind of information lets scientists re-construct pre-historic food chains, and work out what neanderthals and dinosaurs were eating. In the case of the fossilised plankton, scientists can even piece together the structure of the living plankton community, and work out what the water might have been like.
The shape of coprolites can also tell us about the evolution of guts in ancient animals, which are rarely preserved in the fossil record.

In some cases, coprolites can transform over time, and get really quite pretty. For example, these pyritised coprolites from Australia - most likely from long-extinct marsupials. 'Pyritisation' occurs in materials that have an abundance of sulphur, which allow the iron sulphide mineral pyrite, or 'fools gold', to precipitate.
