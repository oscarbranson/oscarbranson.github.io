During Darwin's famous voyage aboard the Beagle, he did a lot more than visit the Galapagos to look at Finches. It was a round-the-world voyage of scientific discovery. In the 1830s he visited South America, where he found several enormous fossils that, until recently, defied everything we know about the mammalian family tree.

The highlights include elephant-like creatures (Mastodons), 4-tonne 6-meter-long ground-sloths (Megatheria), armadillos the size of cars (Glyptodon, in picture), rhinocerous-sized guinea pigs (Toxodon), and strange humpless camels (Macrauchenia). Since their discovery many of Darwin's mystery beasts have puzzled scientists, and we've had a hard time working out where they came from, and how they evolved.

We know that they all belong to a group of 'South American Ungulates' (ungulate = 'hoofed animal'), which went extinct around 12000 years ago, but that's about it. The best way of working out how groups of animals evolve is by analysing rare fragments of DNA that survive in the bones of these long-dead animals, but so far this DNA has proved elusive.

Some scientists recently worked out a new way of tracing the ancestry of these strange animals. Instead of hunting for rare DNA fragments, they analysed collagen fibres - a complex protein that is a major component of mammal bones. It is much more easily preserved than DNA, and has changed enough through time that you can trace distinct lineages of collagen ancestry back through the mammal family tree.

By analysing the collagen fibres from twelve-thousand-year-old Toxodon and Macrauchenia bones, the researchers were able to work out that the South American Ungulate group shared a common ancestor with horses, tapirs and rhinos (Perissodactyla). Now we know where they came from, we can start working out how and why these animals got so bizarre.
