A few weeks ago, I foolishly entered a [NERC Photography and Short Article Writing competition](http://www.nerc.ac.uk/press/releases/2013/87-competition/). I didn’t win.

This is what I entered:

  <figcaption>The microscopic shell of Ammonia tepida. Smaller than a grain of sand, this shell is made by a single-celled organism called a ‘foraminifera’. This picture was taken using X-rays from a synchrotron particle accelerator (Diamond, Oxford), and reveals the fantastic complexity inside the shell.</figcaption>

And the writing to go with it:

>I study plankton. For fun, but also for my PhD.

>The term plankton covers any animal or plant that lives in the ocean, and cannot control where they end up. The clue is in the name – planktos is Greek for ‘drifter’. This description isn’t particularly useful, and covers a truly mind-boggling diversity of sizes, shapes and lifestyles: from impossibly tiny micro-bacteria, to the enormous Lion’s Mane jellyfish, 2m in diameter, with tentacles longer than 3 buses!

>Every drop of seawater is teeming with microscopic life, with its own complicated ecosystem of plants, grazers and predators all striving to survive. This microscopic tangle of life provides food for all the animals in the sea, and indirectly supports most life on land. They are an integral part of global nutrient cycling, cloud formation, regulating the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, and produce the oxygen in every second breath you take. In short, they are important!

>In this strange, unexplored micro-world, it’s easy to get caught up in how little we understand, and just marvel at the fantastic creatures as they float by. But in science, this is frowned upon. We pick a detail of the complicated picture, and work away frantically: we hypothesise, and scheme, and reduce the detail to numbers. We categorise it, describe it, and seek to understand it, and so the puzzle is slowly completed.

>My particular piece of the puzzle is shells. Yes. Plankton can make shells. Even the plants try their hand at sculpting minerals to their advantage, and produce some truly incredible and improbable structures. They make them predominantly from calcium carbonate or silica. I study the former.

>We are interested in these shells because of what they can tell us about the past. Each of these tiny structures provides us with a snapshot of the world it lived in, and by looking at fossil shells in deep ocean mud, we can look back in time and seek to understand how our planet works.

>We can work out the temperature and pH of the ocean, we can estimate how much ice there was on the planet, we can tell how productive (i.e. ‘how much life was in’) the ocean was, we can track the movements of ocean currents, and we can begin to understand the way the world was before records began; and all from something you would not be able to distinguish from a grain of sand.

Those of you familiar with my blog might recognise a lot of the text from my [first post]({% post_url /blog/2013-07-27-my-work-plankton %})… not that I entered this competition in any kind of last-minute, slap-dash way, of course!

The result: I got shortlisted, which was nice.

The winner (by Paul Hopwood of the University of Exeter) was really cool: a picture of a pair of awful burying beetles. The pair black and orange shiny, hairy creatures, are feeding on a rotting carcass, while nursing their young (maggots toward the top of the picture). The female (top) is covered in horrible, parasitic mites. A striking, if rather morbid picture.
