NASA's Cassini spacecraft heated up the extra-terrestrial life debate last week, by finding evidence of hot-springs on Enceladus, Saturn's sixth largest moon.

We've known about ice on Enceladus for several decades, but the freezing temperatures on the surface (highs of -198ºC) made life there extremely unlikely. Back in 2005 Cassini saw giant plumes of water vapour coming from Enceladus' south pole, erupting up to 30km from the surface. This told us that somewhere in Enceladus there was enough heat to create liquid water - the vital ingredient for life. Gravitational measurements of Enceladus have since revealed that there could be an ocean up to 10km deep underneath the moon's icy surface. This upgraded Enceladus from a frozen wasteland, to one of the most promising places in our solar system to look for alien life.

Last week, a paper published in Nature reported Cassini's latest, sensational observations from Enceladus: hot springs. The scientists behind this discovery noticed that the water erupting from Enceladus contains nano-sized silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) particles. Using a combination of Cassini's observations, laboratory experiments and basic chemical and physical principles, the scientists were able to show that these particles must have come from active hot-springs, deep in Enceladus' oceans.

So what's all the fuss about? We're not talking about a photo of E.T. relaxing in a Spa here, so why has this got the extra-terrestrial crowd so excited? Hot-springs, or hydrothermal vents, are present throughout the deep ocean on Earth. They are remarkable because, despite existing in the pitch-black ocean depths, they are teeming with life. The scorching hot water (up to 400ºC) and minerals spewing from the vents provides all the energy this ecosystem needs. Many researchers think that life on Earth began at hydrothermal vents.

Finding them on Enceladus is exciting because it means that this small, icy moon has liquid water, heat and vigorous chemical reactions: all the ingredients for life. This could mean that bacterial life, and possibly more complex organisms, could exist there.
