The plight of Arctic ice is brought to life in this new animation by NOAA, showing how the ice moves and ages over time.

During the cold winter months a layer of sea ice forms over the entire Arctic ocean. Over the summer most of this ice melts and breaks up, but a central cap of ice remains over the cold North Pole. While this polar ice cap is always present, it is not a single, constant piece of ice. The animation shows how the ice cap is constantly in flux, replenished each year by thousands of fragments of winter ice that survived the summer melt.

The ice fragments that make it into the polar ice cap tend to be the thickest, strongest pieces of the winter ice. Once there, they thaw a little each summer and are replenished each winter. These ice fragments can survive for many years, as long as the melting does not overtake the amount of freezing. In the 1980s 26% of the ice was over 4 years old. Eventually, the constantly shifting ice carries these old fragments to warmer waters, where the summer melting outstrips the winter freezing, and they disappear. In recent years rising temperatures have reduced the size of the region where old ice can survive. This is reducing the 'lifetime' of ice in the polar cap. In 2014 less than 10% of ice was more than 4 years old.

We're constantly hearing about melting ice in the Arctic, but this video brings a fresh new look at what an 'ice cap' really is, and how it works. The ice cap is more than a single year of ice formation - it accumulates over a decade or more, and is the result of a complex, dynamic system. This means that a single year of increased ice cover (like 2012) does little replenish the 'health' of the polar ice cap, which is getting gradually younger, thinner and more fragile as the average amount of freezing decreases, and melting increases.

The animation is based on a combination of satellite imagery, and the movement of tracking buoys in the Arctic.
