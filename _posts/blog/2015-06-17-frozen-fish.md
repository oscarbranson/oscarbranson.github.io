Earlier this year, scientists found a fish living in thin layer of seawater, trapped under 740 m of ice 840 km away from the nearest coast line.

The team of scientists from the 'WISSARD' project work in remote areas of Antarctica trying to understand how stable ice sheets are, and how stability effects their melting. Part of this work involves drilling deep bore-holes through ice sheets 100s of meters thick (they use a 'hot water drill'). These holes offer biologists the unique opportunity to see what can live in the pitch-black, isolated environments beneath the ice sheets.
Recently, the WISSARD team tested out a new toy, the Deep-SCINI robot. This torpedo-shaped robot can be lowered down their thin boreholes and drive around in the water pockets at their base, collecting samples and photographing the alien environment.

This sub-glacial world is dark and cold: a low-energy environment. Complex life usually requires an intense energy source to keep it going; on the surface of the Earth we get our energy from the sun, and animals at hydrothermal vents (http://goo.gl/sGg5Ia) get it from the boiling hot chemical soup that erupts out of the ocean floor. We don't know of any similar energy source under the ice. Experienced microbiologists on the WISSARD team were expecting to find nothing more than a few slow-growing microbes at the bottom of their bore-hole. You can imagine the amazement when they turned their camera on under the ice, and were greeted by a fish.

Over a 6 hour dive, the scientists saw around 40 fish (of three types), as well as dozens of unusual crustaceans. The WISSARD scientists are now trying to work out what this complex ecosystem lives on, and are revising some of their ideas about what life is capable of.
