Or: [Look!](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X13005487)  I published a paper! This is what we did…

As I explained in [my first post](), I study plankton. One of the main reasons I’m interested in these tiny bugs is that their shells record the state of the world they live in. By [digging deep holes in the ocean floor](http://www.iodp.org/), we can get at the shells of plankton that lived millions of years ago; shells that contain a tiny chemical snapshot of the world it lived in.

Lots of people spend their lives getting these tiny shells and analysing their chemistry using big machines. They relate shell chemistry to the environment, and generate long-term records of climate cycles going deep into the immeasurable past, that are essential to our understanding of the planet. I come at things from a different angle – I look at how the chemicals get in the shells in the first place: what they really mean, and how far we can trust them.

Two years ago, I went to [ALS](http://www-als.lbl.gov/) for the first time. Perched in a eucalyptus forest on a crest of hills just east of Berkeley, with views over the whole Bay Area, and the Golden Gate shining in the distance. It’s a great place to be a scientist! Being from Cambridge, we felt we had a certain eccentricity to uphold, so instead of staying in the laboratory hostel we hired an RV, and camped in their car park (1/5th of the cost!). On arrival, the security guard was nonplussed, and shouted ‘Nice ride!’. In our car park, we were woken up by turkeys, and looked at by deer. The word quickly went round to ‘look out for the mad Brits by the South gate…’.

ALS is the Advanced Light Source: essentially a (very) big lightbulb that produces very precise X-Rays. If you’re thinking of a lightbulb in the traditional sense, I’ll have to get you back on track slightly – the ALS is a [synchrotron]({% post_url /blog/2013-08-13-from-a-synchrotron %}). An enormous ring of magnets accelerates electrons to 99.9% the speed of light. The electrons pass through clever magnetic devices called ‘undulators’, and produce the very precise X-Rays which radiate off the ring on tangents, and power the ‘beamlines’ of the synchrotron where all the work happens. It’s these X-Rays that bring us California.

We arrive with our carefully prepared slices of plankton shell. Approximately 10×15 µm small (a human hair is around 100 µm in diameter), and 100 nm (1000 nm in a µm) thin. They’re very small. Just to get them to this stage has taken weeks of preparation, using a ‘focussed ion beam’ instrument – a machine that literally digs small holes in things by bombarding it with helium atoms. Ridiculous! So we have prepared painstakingly, flown half-way across the world (during which my face when numb… but that’s another story), hired an RV, somehow driven it along crowded freeways to the ALS in search of precise X-Rays, and against all odds, survived. Why?

We’re here to study magnesium (Mg). Mg is a ‘trace element’ in shells. That is, most (99.9%) of the shell is made of what it’s supposed to be made of (calcium carbonate, CaCO3), but some small impurities get in while the shell is growing – like Mg. Back in the ’50s, people noticed that shells have more Mg in when the water is hotter. Since then this relationship has been developed and refined, and Mg is used as a ‘proxy’ for past ocean temperature. People can work out what temperature the ocean was 50 million years ago.

Recently, people have started to look more closely and Mg in shells, and noticed a lot of strange things going on. It’s not simply a case of Mg getting into the crystal following simple, physical rules (viz. thermodynamics and kinetics of crystal growth): the concentration of Mg varies enormously within individual shells, in a way that looks a lot like growth rings in trees. Every time the plankton adds a bit more shell, it gets another ‘ring’ of high Mg. This worried us a bit – what does this mean for all the records of Mg that we have related to temperature? How reliable is this proxy that we are relying on to understand the planet? That’s why we’re here.

We’ve come to check the fundamental assumptions behind the Mg temperature proxy. In practice, this means looking at how the Mg is incorporated in the shell mineral: is it present in the underlying structure of the crystal of the shell, or is it sitting in some other mineral in these ‘tree-rings’, or is it tied up in some complicated organic compound? This is where the X-Rays come in. We put our tiny wafer of plankton in a moderately big machine called a Scanning Transmission X-Ray Microscope (STXM). In this machine, we focus the X-Rays to a tiny point (30nm) on our sample, and scan that point around, measuring the absorption of X-Rays across our sample. Different energies of X-Ray interact with different, specific elements in different ways, so by fine-tuning the energy of our X-Rays, we can work out exactly where our Mg is, and what state it’s in in our samples. If you want to read more about what we did, take a look at [our paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X13005487), which was recently published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters. It’s even open access, so you don’t have to pay Elsevier’s exorbitant article fees.

In the end, all was well – Mg was clearly hosted in the mineral, where everyone thought it had been all along. Mg really does tell us about temperature. Phew! But if this is what everyone thought happened all along, why all the fuss? Why have we published a paper about something everyone already assumed? The key here is that it was an assumption. No-one had rigorously tested the fundamentals of the main tools we use to understand past climate. Now we have! Woop!

Next up, we’ll be looking at boron – a palaeo-pH meter.
