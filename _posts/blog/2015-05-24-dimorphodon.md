We've got a big one for you today. Think Brachiosaurus ([its Western cousin](https://goo.gl/SnKE2U){:target="_blank"}), but quite a lot bigger and elongated.

| **Common Name**      | Dimorphodon (Die-morf-oh-don)                  |
| **Size**             | up to 1 m long, 1.5 m wingspan (3.3, 4.6 ft)   |
| **Age**              | Early Jurassic (195 â€“ 190 million years ago)   |
| **Geographic Range** | England, North America                         |
| **Liked**            | Eating insects                                 |
| **Disliked**         | Trying to fly                                  |
| **Taxonomy**         | Animalia > Chordata > Pterosauria > Dimorphodontidae |

This little pterosaur is slated to appear in the Aviary of Jurassic World.  We're told they're going to escape and attack people... like every dinosaur in Jurassic anything.

Dimorphodon is small, [as pterosaurs go](https://www.facebook.com/TheEarthStory/posts/877364952324550){:target="blank"}. The largest pterosaurs could have wingspans as big as 10 m (33 ft). It had a disproportionately large head, and short stubby wings. It had a low centre of gravity, and limbs that were particularly suited for climbing - much like a big, pterosaur-y squirrel. Its short wings, and relatively bulky body mean that it probably wasn't a 'soaring' flyer, like other pterosaurs. It was more likely to have spent most of its time scampering around on the ground an in trees, only taking to a frenetic, fluttering flight when it absolutely had to - like to get from tree to tree, or to avoid being eaten.

Its conspicuously large skull is remarkably similar to a puffin's. This has lead to numerous depictions of it with a puffin-like beak, like in the picture. This skull was full of of two kinds of teeth, which is where it got its name (Dimorphodon = 'two shaped teeth'). All its teeth were variations on 'sharp and pointy', which would have made its yawn rather frightening. Despite its ghastly appearance, it probably fed on insects, and possibly small animals and fish. Its jaw muscles were relatively weak, and set up for 'snap and hold' feeding. This means that it could close its jaws extremely quickly, and keep them shut, but they had very little power - not the biting, crushing, powerful jaws of a big carnivore, but excellent for catching fast-moving insects.

It's quite likely that they'll be larger, and much more ferocious in Jurassic World, and not at all squirrel-like.
