This week I am at the annual conference of the [Geochemical Society][] in Florence: [Goldschmidt 2013][].

[Goldschmidt 2013]: http://goldschmidt.info/2013/

This eclectic conference covers anything related to geochemistry: the science that describes the distribution of chemical elements in nature. In practice, this means anything from the metabolic processes of microbes to the formation of planets, and everything in between. There are around 4000 scientists here from all over the world. I will be updating my blog each day with more about the content of the conference.

The namesake of the conference is the Swiss prodigy [Victor Moritz Goldschmidt][], widely regarded as the father of modern geochemistry. Alongside Vladimir Vernadsky, he was one of the first scientists to consider why elements were distributed as they were in nature, and think about the processes behind the distribution and what they meant. These first steps have led to a broad discipline of science that seeks to understand our world and others by investigating the distribution and behaviour of chemicals in it.

The conference is being held in the menacing Fortezza da Basso. Commissioned in the 16th century Alessandro deâ€™ Medici, and active during the second world war, the vast fort now houses a vast conference centre. There are big, open spaces in a large central building filled with smaller semi-soundproof boxes where the talks happen. As each set of talks finish small bursts of applause appear at random from the boxes and echo round the spaces in between, followed by a rush of people bustling to the next set of talks. It is a strange place!
