Baryonyx is [Spinosaurus'](https://goo.gl/9RTLFy) smaller, less spiny cousin.

Baryonyx (from Greek, meaning 'heavy claw') gets its name from the scary-looking 25 cm (10 in) curved claw on the thumb of each hand. Think the Jurassic Park Velociraptor claw, but three times the size. Yikes.

It's mouth was long and crocodile-like, with 96 serrated teeth. That's twice as many teeth as T-Rex. The shape and arrangement of its teeth tell us that Baronyx was a fish eater. It probably spent its time sitting on river banks, swiping fish out of the water with it's ridiculous thumb-claws.

Baryonyx was found relatively recently (1983) in a clay quarry in southern England. The fossil was so well preserved that it had partially digested fish scales in its stomach. These scales caused a revelation in the dinosaur world, and allowed palaeontologists to properly identify numerous similar fossils from around the world as fish-eaters, and started a completely new group of piscivorous dinosaurs (the Spinosaurs).

This fish-eater was supposed to be the main antagonist of Jurassic Park III, but it was upstaged by the discovery of its larger relative, the [Spinosaurus](https://goo.gl/9RTLFy), which made for a much more fearsome enemy. It seems that Baryonyx will have its moment though, as it is slated to appear in Jurassic World
