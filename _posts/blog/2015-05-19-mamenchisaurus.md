We've got a big one for you today. Think Brachiosaurus ([its Western cousin](https://goo.gl/SnKE2U){:target="_blank"}), but quite a lot bigger and elongated.

| **Common Name**      | Mamenchi Ferry reptile                         |
| **Size**             | up to 35 m (115 ft) long                       |
| **Age**              | Late Jurassic (160 â€“ 145 million years ago)    |
| **Geographic Range** | China                                          |
| **Liked**            | Being big                                      |
| **Disliked**         | Short necks                                    |
| **Taxonomy**         | Animalia > Chordata > Dinosauria > Sauropodomorpha > Mamenchisauridae |

Mamenchisaurs were a big, four-legged herbivores, with a freakishly long necks, up to half the length of their bodies. The largest species was 35m long, with 18m of neck. That's roughly one and a half buses of neck. The longest neck of any animal ever to have lived, ever. Its neck was SO big that it had its own ribs (cervical ribs).

Why, you ask? We're not really sure. Leading hypotheses include competition with other long-necked Sauropods for those top-most juicy tree-leaves, or the result of 'sexual selection'. Sexual selection is the evolutionary process that got the peacock its ridiculous tail. It describes the evolution of a characteristic that has no obvious benefit to the animal, other than attracting a mate - the evolution of the species is determined by what the females find sexy... In the case of the Mamenchisaurus, it could have been long necks?

This big grazer appears briefly in 'The Lost World', just before the Pachycephalosaurus we [talked about yesterday](https://goo.gl/5t1C55){:target="_blank"}, as part of a stampeding herd of herbivores. A motorcycle rides between its legs. How rude.
