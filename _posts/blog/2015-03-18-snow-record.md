Last Sunday Boston got a paltry 7.4 cm of new snow. This pushed the season total up to 2.77 m (just over 9 feet), more snow than Boston has experienced since records began in 1873.

This phenomenal snow-dump has been smashing some other records too: $35 million spent on snow and ice removal, which is almost double the city's snow budget. The snow has been coming so thick and fast that simply ploughing the roads hasn't been enough. City workers have been exporting their frozen excess to 'snow farms' outside the city (now full), and melting it in specialised 'snow melting machines'.

On the human side, Bostonians have been trying to keep their spirits up by dressing up as Yetis, and digging bike tunnels through snow drifts. Some entrepreneurial spirits have been packing up this 'record breaking snow' and selling it to people across the USA. The snow has undoubtedly taken a toll, though, as city infrastructure recently declared a 'state of emergency', and the annual Boston parade has just been cancelled.

Four out of Boston's top five snowfall years have happened since 1993. As Senator Inhofe recently pointed out with the help of an infamous snowball, the record-breaking snow that Boston and the North-East are experiencing clearly shows that global warming is a myth... No. No it doesn't. While it's very hard to attribute any individual storm to climate change, this kind of abnormal weather fits well with how we expect a warming planet to behave. The short story is: more heat on the planet means more evaporation, which means more moisture in the air, and more precipitation. The record snowfall in the North East USA this year was accompanied by record high sea surface temperatures off New England (11.5ºC, or 21ºF), which fuelled the incessant snow storms. For a more detailed explanation of this, see the links at the bottom.

Back in Boston, the snow season isn't over yet, and forecasters are predicting more snow into the weekend.
