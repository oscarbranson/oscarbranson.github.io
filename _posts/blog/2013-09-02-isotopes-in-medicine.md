### Goldschmidt 2013 – Tuesday

##### Plenary Session: Francis Albarède on ‘Isotopes of Disease’


Geochemists study the natural processes that govern the distribution of chemicals in the world. Some (like me) directly study the minutia of the processes themselves, while others derive information about the processes by looking at the chemical signatures they produce. [Francis Albarède](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/francis.albarede/) has provided a fantastic example of the latter, illustrating the breadth and depth of geochemical techniques by turning them to focus on the intricacies of human health.

In a range of experiments his research group studied the [isotopic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope) ratios of various metals that are present in trace amounts in mammals – Cu, Zn, Fe and others. The researchers analysed various tissues and organs of mice and sheep, and found that different parts of the animal had distinct isotopic signatures.

##### Isotopes

An ‘isotopic signature’ is not an inherently intuitive concept… first of all, you need to understand what an isotope is.  At a basic level, an atom is made up of protons, neutrons and electrons. The protons and electrons are the ‘business end’ of the atom, providing all the forces that cause it to interact with other atoms: repel and attract, form bonds and generally define the physical and chemical properties of the atom. The neutrons just sit in the nucleus of the atom, and make it heavier. An element can have more or fewer neutrons, and still have almost identical physical and chemical properties, but a different weight: these are isotopes.

The ‘*almost identical*‘ is key here: they are not perfectly identical. The presence of extra neutrons makes the atom behave in subtly different ways: at a given energy, a heavier atom will move around slightly less than a lighter atom, making them able to form stronger bonds. This means that as the atoms go through chemical processes where bonds are formed and broken a lot (literally any chemical process in the universe), you will end up with lighter isotopes going one way, and heavier isotopes going another. This is isotopic fractionation.

A very simple example: The two main isotopes of oxygen are <sup>18</sup>O and <sup>16</sup>O: one [mole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant) (6.02214129 × 10<sup>23</sup> atoms) of each isotope of oxygen will weigh 18g and 16g, because of the extra neutrons in there. Water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen, and when it evaporates, the lighter isotope goes first (its bonds to the hydrogen atoms are weaker). This means that water left behind after evaporation will be enriched in heavy oxygen, and the clouds above that water will be enriched in light oxygen. Scientists can use this relationship to find out all sorts of things about global temperatures, and the amount of ice on the planet, by considering the ratios of heavy to light oxygen isotopes that we find in various materials… but that’s [another story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9418O).

Back to our bodies!

##### Isotopes in YOU

Francis Albarède’s research group found that different parts of animals had consistently different isotopic signatures. The ‘heaviness’ of Cu, Zn and Fe vary a lot between tissues and organs, and between animals. Despite all this variation, the isotope ratios of a single tissue in a single animal stays remarkable constant, regardless of the diet or lifestyle of the animal. This means that the biology of healthy tissues and organs will fix the isotopic ratio of different trace metals in them, depending on how it puts them to work.

The next step in this process would be to ask, ‘what happens when a tissue or organ goes wrong?’, which is exactly what these scientists did. In a series of rather sobering slides, Dr Alberède talked the audience through Cu isotope data from a number of cancer patients. These graphs aren’t published, so I can’t include any here, but suffice to say that he had to explain that the time scales were all different lengths: often patients died during the course of the experiments.

These graphs were essentially timelines of a patient’s treatment, from diagnosis to recovery or death. They contained three lines – two showing the blood concentrations of traditionally used ‘biomarkers’ of cancer, and one showing the blood copper isotope ratio (the ‘heaviness’ of copper in the blood). Biomarkers are compounds that the body produces when it is fighting a tumour. They are by-products of the immune system, so there is a time lag between the body realising what’s going on, and the production of these biomarkers to the extent where they can be measured by medical techniques.

Not so with copper isotopes. These are affected directly by the growing tumour tissues. Because each tissue type has a distinct isotope ratio, anything going wrong with these tissues will disrupt the isotope ratio in the blood. The copper isotopes rose and fell in the graphs, almost always preceding the fluctuations in traditional biomarkers by a several weeks – vital time in a cancer treatment. There was even one case where the biomarkers showed almost no variation, while the copper isotopes plummeted dramatically until the patient died.

Both this idea and this technique are very new, and there are a host of questions and problems surrounding it, mainly concerned with our lack of understanding of all the processes that can effect isotopes in our body.  For example, another talk I attended discussed the use of copper isotopes for the early diagnosis of Wilson’s disease, which is very manageable if caught early. This is great, but how does this tie in with the cancer story? What other diseases can effect Cu isotopes? Will they only work in ‘simple’ cancer cases?

Clearly there is a long way to go in developing these techniques, but if these isotopes are as useful as they seem, I imagine it won’t be long until our hospitals are equipped with mass spectrometers.
