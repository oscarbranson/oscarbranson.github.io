A Grain of Sand

Sand is soft, scratchy, in all the wrong places, boring... or is it? Each minute sand grain has a diverse and remarkable history, from explosive volcanic eruptions, to the formation and destructions of intricate sea shells. Each grain is somewhere on the journey from formation to destruction, and eventual re-incorporation into the chemical cycles of the planet.

These journeys are captured in the spectacular work of Dr Gary Greenberg, who has been photographing sand for decades. The sand grains in this picture are from Maui, and are mainly the remains of living creatures, some more intact than others. Just in these few grains there are fragments of corals, sea urchins, bivalves, gastropods, bryozoans and encrusting algaes, there are near-complete foraminifera and the skeleton of a juvenile sponge (the three-pronged structure), as well as a few grains of 'terrigenous' material - ground up rocks from the land.
