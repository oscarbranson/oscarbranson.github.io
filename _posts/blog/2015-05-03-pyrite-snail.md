In the depths of the Indian Ocean, at a place where scorching-hot toxic water erupts from tall, black chimneys on the ocean floor, you will find an animal straight out of the pages of science fiction: the 'Scaly Footed Gastropod' (*Chrysomallon squamiferum*). This large snail, 3-4 cm long, gets its name from the 'skirt' of shiny, golden scales that cover the soft parts of its body. These scales are made of the iron sulphide minerals greigite and pyrite, or 'fools gold'. This snail is the only animal we know of to make shells out of these minerals, and the surprises don't stop there. This snail has developed some of the most advanced armour in the natural world.

Its shell is made up of three, unique layers. At the base is a normal aragonite (calcium carbonate) snail shell, the outside of which is covered by a protein-rich organic layer. The outer surface is coated in a fine layer of pyrite. As well as making the shell outrageously shiny, the combination of these layers makes some of the best armour scientists have ever encountered. It can resist piercing, crushing, fracturing, bending and heating, all traits that help it survive in the harsh environment and fierce predators at the hydrothermal vents where it lives. The armour is so good that the US military are studying it to make new forms of body armour.

Just think, how long until you see soldiers with snails on their heads?
