The California Drought is in the news a lot these days. California has just declared a fourth consecutive year of historic drought. In January the governor declared a State of Emergency, and told everyone to prepare for water shortages.

According to a recent NASA study published in Science Advances, and covered elsewhere on the [Earth Story](http://goo.gl/BVYf1x), it's not going to get better any time soon. The NASA Science Visualisation Studio brought these results to life in this startling animation, which shows how the droughts might unfold through the 21st century.

Based on the results of 17 different state-of-the art climate models, these scientists are predicting mega-droughts over the South-Western and Central USA and Mexico over the next century, "unlike anything humans have seen [...] in the last thousand years". The USA has seen similar "dust bowl" droughts in recorded history, most recently in the 1930s. The "Dirty Thirties", as these droughts were known, caused environmental and economic upheaval across the USA, and provided the material for Steinbeck's tragic tale "The Grapes of Wrath", where no-one was having a good time. These past droughts never lasted for longer than 10 years or so. The models in this study are predicting similar levels of drought, but lasting 30-35 years.

Aside from the immediate importance of these findings to the millions of people that either live in the drought affected regions or rely on the food produced there, this study is significant because it directly links rising CO2 and global warming with the risks of imminent severe droughts. The study ran their models at two different CO2 levels - one with current CO2 (400 ppm), and the other with the IPCC predicted "business as usual" CO2 (rising to 1250 ppm by 2100). At current CO2 levels these droughts are very likely (60-80% chance of happening between 2050-2100), and at higher CO2 levels the likelihood goes up to over 80%.

It's true that the models that foretell these grim events are "just models", and models are not straightforward. They all tell slightly different stories, and often don't perfectly predict the real world. However, as models go this study has used the best we've got - based firmly in the physics of how the ocean, atmosphere and land work and interact with each other. The real strength of this study comes in the use of 17 independent models. The results might not all be identical, because the underlying models work in subtly different ways, but they all show the same trends for increased drought risk.
