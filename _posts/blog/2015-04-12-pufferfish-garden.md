For years divers off the coast of Japan encountered these enormous, 2 metre diameter 'mystery circles' on the sandy sea floor. Recently we found out who was making them.

This huge underwater crop-circle is the mating display of the male Torquigener pufferfish. The small (12 cm) fish takes 7-9 days to meticulously prepare one of these elaborate gardens. It seems that the sole purpose of the garden is to attract a mate, and provide a good site to lay her eggs.

If their garden catches a mate's eye, the male will hang around for another 6 days to care for the eggs, before moving on to a new location, and starting a new garden.

This small pufferfish produces one of the most elaborate displays known in nature.
