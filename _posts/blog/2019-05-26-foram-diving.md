It feels a lot like leaping off a cliff. Stepping out into a big nothing, with hundreds of metres to fall before you hit the ground. Sure, there's water in the way, but this doesn't do much to ease the vertigo of Blue Water diving.

Once the flurry of bubbles has cleared there's just blue. Imagine the bluest blue you've ever seen, then double it. Fading from pale, sky-blue near the surface down to an immense, deep dark blue beneath you. No landmarks, no point of reference. Just you, alone, floating over nothingness. It's quite unsettling.

But then the routine kicks in: check the other divers are OK, find the down-line, drop down to the trapeze, clip on your tether, open the gear bags, and get to work! The routine is simple - swim over to 'empties' bag to grab some jars, put forams in the jars, then put them back in the 'full' bag. The tricky bits are first spotting and then catching the forams.

The forams we're catching are of the 'spinose' variety - spherical explosions of spines between 3-10mm in diameter. Light reflects off the spines making them light up like minute fireworks against the blue backdrop. They would be easy to spot, if it weren't for the soup of other plankton and foram-lookalikes in the water. Trichodesmium tufts, radiolarians and acantharians can cause particular complications for the novice collector. Once you get your eye in, it's like being in a well-labelled zoo - each type of plankton has its own way of moving and interacting with the shafts of light glancing down from the surface. You can even start to tell the difference between the species of foraminifera in the water.

Once you've spotted your foram, you then have to catch it. First, you have to synchronise yourself with the movement of the particles in the water, staying perfectly still relative to your drifting prey. All your movements have to be minute - small changes in breathing to control buoyancy, and tiny fin-kicks to reposition yourself. Then you're faced with a tricky problem - how do you get a tiny particle in the water into a jar that's already full of water? Everyone develops their own technique, from swirling the water to create a vortex, to patiently waiting for the foram to drift in on its own, to a quick lid-snap which sucks the foram in. There's definitely an art to this stage!

In a single dive, 2 divers will catch somewhere between 40-80 forams. If the divers are experienced, these can be of a single target species. Each foram is carried serenely back to the lab in its own little parcel of seawater, and is ready for experiments. This is why we dive for forams - we can pick exactly what we need, and each foram we're working on starts happy and healthy, without being subjected to the trauma and excitement of being caught in a plankton net.
