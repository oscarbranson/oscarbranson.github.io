Sand is soft, scratchy, in all the wrong places, and boring... or is it? Each minute sand grain has a remarkable history with roots in diverse geological processes, from explosive volcanic eruptions, to the formation and destruction of intricate sea shells. Each grain is somewhere on its journey from formation to destruction, and will eventually be re-cycled into the planet's huge, slow chemical and physical cycles.

These journeys are captured in the spectacular work of Dr Gary Greenberg, who has been photographing sand for decades. The sand grains in this picture are from Maui, and are mainly the remains of living creatures, some more intact than others.
