Some time around Christmas 2013, while deep in the mire of writing my PhD thesis, I had an idea. It was daft and impractical, but offered a tantalising glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. I was going to cycle from San Francisco to LA.

The broad sweeps of the plan made sense, I was moving to California in the summer, and had a couple of weeks to spare, but it all fell apart in the detail. I had no suitable bike, no clue what I was doing, couldn't speak the language, and was remarkably unfit. I mentioned it to a few friends, and was met with skeptical amusement. Fair enough, I suppose.

One gloomy winter night in a Cambridge pub, everything changed. Someone stole my bike. After the initial rage, it dawned on me - here was my chance to actually make this happen. Armed with my daft plan, I convinced myself to spend far too much money on a [wonderful, British-racing-green bicycle touring machine](). Having spent All Of The Money, I realised that I actually had to do this.

Next, I started to recruit fellow travellers. For some reason no-one was able or keen to drop everything, fly half-way round the world with me, and subject themselves to 350 miles of cycling. Finally, over a quiet dinner with some friends in London, I jokingly asked if anyone would like to join me. Astonishingly, Charlie said yes!

And we were off. The departure date was a few months away, but the trip was now a tangible thing. I spent far too much time geekily trawling through the internet of bicycle touring, and equipping my bike and myself for the road ahead. If you're interested, or preparing for a similar trip, all the gory details are in a [separate post]().

####The Trip

I made my move to California, equipped with one large rucksack and one large bicycle. That was it.
