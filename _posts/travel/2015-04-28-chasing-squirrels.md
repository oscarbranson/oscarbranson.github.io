Last weekend we embarked upon the Best Worst Idea Ever: to go to a delightful wedding, drive one and a half hours to sleep in a glorified car-park under the stars, and then get up at 5 am to cycle 100 miles. What could possibly go wrong? And so began the [Chico Wildflower century](https://www.chicovelo.org/wildflower-april.html).

We left the wedding late to arrive at cycle start point around midnight. Too tired and drunk to think about tents, we threw our sleeping bags on the ground, and slept out under the stars, because apparently that's a thing in California. We woke to the sound of a kindly citizen mowing their lawn at 4am. After the appropriate cursing and muted threats, we calmed ourselves with thimbles full of coffee provided by the ride organisers, and were treated to a spectacular sunrise over not-so-distant Sierras.

Breakfast and coffee done, we pedalled away around 6:30. An endless stream of people of all abilities - from small children on minute BMXes, to 70-year-old women, to one-armed MAMILs (Middle Aged Men In Lycra) riding racing machines that cost as much as a luxury car. There are many versions of the ride, with various combinations of hills and distances, and every so often you all come together for bits of the route, which is fun, and occasionally catastrophic.

The ride began up a horrendously bumpy track, which went rumbling up the a big old flood basalt (lava flow), sloping up towards the Sierras. We wove our way amongst varying degrees of incompetent cyclist, lurching all over the place while we tried to overtake them ('on your left', you would say when wanting to go past, and they career off to the right, almost taking out their neighbours. ARGH!).  At the top of this we turned, and swooped back down a wonderful long downhill, with views over the central valley and mountains in the distance.

From there, we wiggled our way on to a spectacularly lush valley road, cut in the same flood basalt we rode up at the start. Many 'trespassers will be shot' and jesus-themed signs. Eventually up a BIG hill ('Paradise'? I beg to differ) to climb out of the valley. We pedalled up a small, steep and winding road through forested slopes full of wildflowers, very few of which I recognised. Again, the full spectrum of incompetent cyclists was out and about, and we zoomed past them all with abandon.

Note bike-chain-bling necklace, bling-necessitated gang sign, bemused orange cyclist, and god-knows-what blue fluff in the background. Pretty much sums up the day, really. I now have a razor-sharp sunburn line where my sleeves were rolled up.</figcaption>

I arrived knackered at the top of the hill, and my chain fell off. Bother. Luckily at top of hill, with a 'rest stop', complete with mechanics and snacks, only half a mile ahead.  I walked/free-wheeled the rest of the way, to have my chain put back on by a friendly mechanic.

After that, we zoomed down the other side of the hill, gradually heading back on to the valley floor. About a mile later, my front gear shifters stopped working. Double bother.  I only had my high-range gears, which was not so good for the impending monstrous hill.  I made a detour to the lunch stop for one of the different routes to try and get my gears fixed. They couldn't do it ("Naaah... sorry man, these are fucked."), so they just put me in my 10 easy gears, so I could get up the hill. I then pedalled off monstrously to try and catch up with the others, which I did, to cries of "The British are coming!".

This hill was tough. Another small winding valley road past lakes and trees, back onto the top of the flood basalt, called 'table mountain', ostensibly the site of all wild flowers. Up we ground, with many shouts of 'shut up legs!' to encourage ourselves, and those we overtook (zoom!).  Cursed and oathed at a sign 3/4 of a mile from the top, which said 'Eureka, you've done it!'. Grrr.  At the actual top we were greeted by an elderly couple sitting by the side of the road ringing a cowbell, and cheering ("Git 'r done!"" shouted the man). Excellent.  And then a rest-stop (See our triumphant photo).

You will notice, from the photo, a distinct lack of wildflowers.  They'd come early this year.  Triple bother.  We found some as we began to descend - through lush green orchards with tiny horses, cows, goats and puppies, frolicking amongst pools of buttercups and daisies and foreign purple things.  Sasquatch statues emerging from thickets, and a wonderful, swooping downhill road back down to the valley and LUNCH!

From there, a 40 mile flat slog through delightful orchards into a horrible headwind.  Somewhere around mile 80 I had a second wind, and began 'chasing squirrels', as one of my fellow pedallers called it. I decided I'd try to catch up with the cyclists ahead of us, which I did. My original plan was to then re-join the group... but there there was someone else in front of them, so I just kept going.  Every time I caught up with someone, there was someone else a few hundred hards in front, and on I went, just getting faster and faster, until I suddenly came to the finish.

At the finish, we were met with spectacular food - heaps of polenta-lasagna, rice-salads, lentil-salads, salad-salads. Then we drove back to Davis to collapse.  A great ride, a good day.
