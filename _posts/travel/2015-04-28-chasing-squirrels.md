Last weekend we embarked upon the Best Worst Idea Ever: to go to a delightful wedding, drive one and a half hours to sleep in a glorified car-park under the stars, and then get up at 5 am to cycle 100 miles. What could possibly go wrong? And so began the [Chico Wildflower century](https://www.chicovelo.org/wildflower-april.html).

We left the wedding late to arrive at cycle start point around midnight. Too tired and drunk to think about tents, we threw our sleeping bags on the ground, and slept out under the stars, because apparently that's a thing you can do in California. We woke to the sound of a kindly citizen mowing their lawn at 4am. I mean really... who does that?! After the appropriate cursing and muted threats, we calmed ourselves with thimbles full of coffee and flaccid croissants, and were treated to a spectacular sunrise over not-so-distant Sierras.

We pedalled away around 6:30. An endless stream of pedallists of all ages and abilities - from small children on minute BMXes, to 70-year-old women, and one-armed MAMILs (Middle Aged Men In Lycra) riding carbon-fibre racing machines that cost as much as a car. I was somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, a shambolic, decidedly lycra-less hungover figure atop a shiny carbon racing bike.

There are many versions of the ride, with various combinations of hills and distances, and every so often you all come together for bits of the route, which is fun, and occasionally catastrophic. We were doing the 'Wildflower Century' - 100 miles with around 1550 m of climbing, ostensibly though spectacular fields of wild flowers.

The ride began up a horrendously bumpy track, which went rumbling up the a big old flood basalt (lava flow), sloping up towards the Sierras. We wove our way between varying degrees of incompetent cyclist, lurching all over the place while we tried to overtake them ('on your left', we would say when wanting to go past, to watch them career off to the right, almost taking out their neighbours). At the top of this we turned, and swooped back down a wonderful long downhill, with views over the central valley and coastal range mountains in the distance.

We wiggled our way on to a spectacularly lush valley road, cut in the same flood basalt we rode up at the start. Many 'trespassers will be shot' and jesus-themed signs. Eventually up a BIG hill ('Paradise'? I beg to differ) to climb out of the valley. A narrow, steep and winding road through forested slopes full of wild flowers (living up to its name so far), very few of which I recognised. Again, the full spectrum of incompetent cyclists was out and about, and we zoomed past them all with abandon. Turns out my new light bike likes to go up hills quickly.

Note bike-chain-bling necklace, bling-necessitated gang sign, bemused orange cyclist, and god-knows-what blue fluff in the background. Pretty much sums up the day, really. I now have a razor-sharp sunburn line where my sleeves were rolled up.</figcaption>

I arrived knackered at the top of the hill, and my chain fell off. Bother. Luckily at top of hill, with a 'rest stop', complete with mechanics and snacks, only half a mile ahead.  I walked/free-wheeled the rest of the way, to have my chain put back on by a friendly mechanic.

Fed, watered and re-chained, we set off down the other side of the hill, gradually heading back to the valley floor. About a mile in, my front gear shifters stopped working. Bother. With only my high-range gears, the impending monstrous hill was worrysome, at best. I made a detour to the lunch stop for one of the different routes to try and get my gears fixed. They couldn't do it ("Naaah... sorry dude, these are fucked."), so they just put me in my low-range gears, and sent me on my way. I then pedalled off monstrously to try and catch up with the others, which I eventually did to cries of "the British are coming!".

This hill was steep and winding. Another small valley road past lakes and trees, back onto the top of the flood basalt, called 'table mountain', ostensibly the site of the most spectacular wild flowers. Up we ground, with many shouts of 'shut up legs!' to encourage ourselves, and those we overtook (zoom!). We cursed at a sign 3/4 of a mile from the top, which said 'Eureka, you've done it!'. At the actual top we were greeted by an elderly couple sitting by the side of the road ringing a cowbell, and cheering ("Git 'r done!"" shouted the man). Excellent.  And then a rest-stop (See our triumphant photo).

You will notice, from the photo, a distinct lack of wildflowers. They'd come early this year. Bother. We found some as we began to descend - through lush green orchards with tiny horses, cows, goats and puppies, frolicking amongst pools of buttercups and daisies and foreign purple things.  Sasquatch statues emerging from thickets, and a wonderful, swooping downhill road back down to the valley and LUNCH!

From there, a 40 mile flat slog through delightful orchards into a horrible headwind.  Somewhere around mile 80 I had a second wind, and began 'chasing squirrels', as one of my fellow pedallers called it. I decided I'd try to catch up with the cyclists ahead of us, which I did. Originally, my plan was to re-join the group... but there was someone else a few hundred yards in front, so I just kept going. Every time I caught up with someone, there was another squirrel to chase, and on I went, getting faster and faster, until suddenly 100 miles was up.

At the finish, we were met with spectacular food - heaps of polenta-lasagna, rice-salads, lentil-salads, salad-salads. Then we drove back to Davis to collapse.  A great ride, a good day.
