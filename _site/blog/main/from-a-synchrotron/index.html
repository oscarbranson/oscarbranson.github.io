<p>I am sitting in an enormous, shiny doughnut. It is 240 metres across, took 4 years to make, and cost £383 million.</p>

<p>On the inside, it is silver, grey and yellow. The floor and walls are grey, the arching roof is shiny, silver and flimsy. Every 20 metres or so a path around the rim is cut by a vast yellow pipe, or box. In the centre of the doughnut is a raised, angular ring, with yellow mesh walkways. Everything hums. The whole place smells of concrete dust. I’m at a synchrotron: the <a href="http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/About.html">Diamond Light Source</a>.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/synchrotron/overview.jpg" />
  <figcaption>A view along the inside of the Diamond doughnut.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Everywhere yellow is dangerous. You need to have watched an online video and taken a test to go there. The angular ring with mesh walkways in the centre is the heart of the synchrotron, the yellow blocks radiate out on tangents. These conceal the business end of the synchrotron – layers of concrete and lead, insulating a frighteningly powerful beam of X-rays 100 billion (100,000,000,000… or in scientific terms, MANY) times brighter than the sun. The beam, although only around the size of a human hair, will give you a lethal radiation dose in a fraction of a second, or so the online presentation told me. Although it also told me that the average worker here gets less X-Ray exposure in a whole year than you get on a half-hour [1], so I breath a bit easier.</p>

<figure class="right" style="width:300px">
  <img src="/images/synchrotron/yellowdoor.jpg" />
  <figcaption>The heavy yellow door that goes ‘thunk’.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the outward side of these these big yellow boxes, we reach the other end of the scale, and the reason we’re here: minutely delicate machines, slaved over and perfected to examine things smaller than it’s easy to imagine. The yellow boxes, or ‘hutches’, vary from the size of a small garden shed, to a cavernous room where you could happily have a game of tennis. Entry is via a heavy, concrete and lead door that opens and closes with a satisfying ‘thunk’ as all the safety interlocks tell the control room which x-rays are allowed out of their tubes. The kind of door that you have to put your whole weight behind to shift. You have to creep round the heavy door, brandishing a gently ticking Geiger counter – the last failsafe in a long line of idiot-proofing to make sure you don’t irradiate yourself. If it squeals, something has gone wrong, and you close the door as quickly as possible. That hasn’t happened yet.</p>

<p>Once inside you’re confronted with a shambles of organised chaos. All the walls are lined with racks of wires, all labelled, colour-coded and running to carefully planned places. There are lights of various shapes and sizes, alarms, sirens, monitors, safety rails and buttons, all sitting silent and watching you. All the chaos focuses on a single point: a complicated looking array of rails, motors, odd-shaped bits of metal, and tubes, all perched atop an unfeasibly large lump of granite on groaning foam legs. The instrument.</p>

<p>At the moment, there are 18 such yellow boxes working at Diamond, and several more being built. One day there will be 40. These run 24 hours a day, for most of the year, with people and experiments coming from all over the world to visit them. Each box contains a different type of instrument, suited to a specific area of science, and set of techniques. Some take X-ray images, almost exactly the same as hospital x-ray images, but of much, much smaller things. Others are built to determine the structures of proteins, viruses and minerals, investigate the properties of micro-electronics, or examine the state and distribution of particular chemicals within a substance (to name but a few). An astonishing range of obscure and wonderful research goes on here!</p>

<p>Once your sample is in, and everything is set, you touch your safety-approved ID card to a special pad by the door. ARGH! Sirens start screaming, yellow lights start flashing. This is truly horrible at 3am. I calm the screams of the sirens slightly by imagining them saying in a soothing voice “This room is about to be filled with mega-death-rays, please leave if you want to live”. Except for one person – the person that has touched their ID card to the sensor has to patrol the area, pressing a series of buttons designed to make sure you search in all corners, and behind all barriers. You can’t press them too quickly, or too slowly (people notice). Once all these buttons are satisfied, you can shut the heavy door (‘thunk!’), and the sirens cease (thank god…), to be replaced by a constant whine of a second siren (ARGH!). At this point, all the lights in the room have gone off, and been replaced by UV lights. Everything has gone purple, and UV-sensitive signs marking the doors, and the emergency stop buttons glow brightly, warning anyone you’ve missed in your search that they have 30 seconds before mega-death-ray time, and they really really really shouldn’t be in there. This tends to be a bad position to be in, not least for the poor trapee, but for all other experiments going on at the synchrotron. An emergency stop button kills the entire synchrotron, and requires a thorough investigation before it can be restarted. Not to be pressed frivolously, or leant on by mistake! After this second wail has ceased, you open the shutters, X-rays pour into the room, and you retire to a bank of computers to shine the light on your sample.</p>

<h3 id="lightbulb">Lightbulb</h3>

<p>So that is a sycnhrotron… but what is this mythical beast? A synchrotron is a type of <del>cyclotron</del> particle accelerator (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/suziesheehy">@suziesheehy</a>). That might not be as unhelpful as it first seems: both are ‘-trons’. We come into contact with trons all the time – powering our lights, charging our batteries – ‘tron’ is a suffix extracted from ‘electron’. ‘Cyclo-‘ is a derivation of ‘kyklos’, the ancient Greek for circle. So a cyclotron is a circle of electrons, and a synchrotron is a synchronised circle of electrons. Is this helping?</p>

<p>I’ll try to move away from jargon for a moment here, and return to basics: electrons are one of the three particles (alongside protons and neutrons) that you will have been told make up an atom. In reality there are many more subatomic particles… but that’s another story. In this simple version, the protons and neutrons sit in the nucleus of the atom, and the electrons zoom around in a cloud, far away from the nucleus. To put this in perspective, if the nucleus of a hydrogen atom were the same size as our sun, the closest electron would be about 5 times as far away as Neptune (the furthest planet), and slightly larger than Jupiter (the largest planet). That’s very far, and very big. The electrons are held (relatively) close to the atom because they are negatively charged, and are attracted to the positive protons in the nucleus. This relationship between nucleus and electrons defines an atom: the number and arrangement of electrons the atom has defines the shape, colour, reactivity, and all other physical properties of an element.</p>

<p>So if an electron is so vitally important to an atom, how and why do you want to get them in a ring? By getting the electrons moving in this controlled way, we can manipulate them to produce very intense, very precise bursts of light: the X-rays used by synchrotron instruments. A piece of equipment called and undulator (or sometimes a wiggler!) uses magnetic fields to make the electrons move rapidly from side to side (wiggle), which causes them to release energy as light. The positions and intensities of these magnets determines the wavelength of light that they emit, so you can fine-tune your X-rays to a specific energy that suits your samples. If you want to know more about how it works, try this highly polished executive video produced by Diamond:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_xv_GwCgpAc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Synchrotrons are very precise, very expensive lightbulbs.</p>

<p>Because of the various predictable ways in which light interacts with electrons (<a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~ch24/lecture2324_2004.pdf">scattering, absorption, emission</a>), we can find out new and interesting things about our samples by measuring the way the light is altered by passing through them. You can study the minutia of atomic architecture, the precise details of chemical reactions, and begin to understand how things fit together.</p>

<p>In practice, this involves: humming machines, unusual amounts of tin foil, very little sleep, questionable food, glorious/dire settings, scooters, a whole mad, sleepless world of scientists and engineers, constantly badgering away at machines that barely work to understand the minute details of the world. Quite unusual, and at times, very exciting.</p>

<p>What have they accomplished? Huge advances in batteries, semiconductors, molecular structures, anti-biotics, biominerals, atmospheric reactions. So many things would be less without synchrotrons!</p>

<h3 id="three-synchrotrons-and-i">Three synchrotrons and I</h3>

<p>I’ve had the privilege of spending around a month at three synchrotrons over the last two years: the <a href="http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/About.html">Diamond Light Source</a> (Harwell, Oxfordshire), the <a href="http://www-als.lbl.gov/">Advanced Light Source</a> (Berkeley, CA) and <a href="http://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/forschung/grossgeraete/beschleunigerphysik/bessy2/index_en.html">BESSY II</a> (Adlershof, near Berlin). Each is distinct, in character, approach and capabilities, and have been great fun in their different ways.</p>

<p>More on these trips later, but here is a synchrotron-view of a tiny plankton shell in the meantime. It’s around 0.2mm long.</p>

<p>[1] Planes go higher in the atmosphere, where the radiation from the sun has had less distance to be absorbed by the air, and is considerably stronger. On an aside, it is this radiation that is causing difficulties for manned missions to Mars (getting there, breathing and eating are comparatively simple!). The sun produces light across the whole electromagnetic spectrum – from radio waves to gamma-rays. Our atmosphere absorbs most of this light before it gets to us – particularly the harmful higher energy UV and X-Rays. In space, there is almost nothing to absorb this, and it hits spacecraft full force.</p>
