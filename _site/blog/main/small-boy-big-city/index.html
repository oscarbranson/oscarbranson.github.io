				<p>What a week.</p>

<p>A week ago today, I finished a draft of my thesis. It feels strange writing that. After a brief attempt to return to being a social being (remember how to move around, interact with people, not stare fixedly over someone’s shoulder while lines of code flicked through my mind…), I moved to London.</p>

<p>London has always terrified me, and more than a little. As long as I can remember I have an almost irrepressible urge to about-turn and hot foot it back to the countryside as soon as I get off the train. The noise, the bustle, the unreasonable number of people all hurrying, determinedly avoiding any kind of interaction… So it was with a considerable trepidation that I raised my hungover self off the sofa, packed a seemingly random assortment of belongings into my oversized rucksack, and cycled off to the station last Sunday evening.</p>

<p>The packing presented the first hurdle: shirts. In London, I was told I would need ‘smart office wear’ (it’s London, that’s the dress code, right? I’ve seen the television…).  I own a suit. Tick. I packed it. I rummaged for shirts, and found a variety of shirt-like objects. On closer inspection, I had managed to acquire what can only be labelled a ‘Cambridge problem’: 5 dress shirts, 3 normal shirts. A shirt imbalance! Woe is me. Baffling. I hadn’t even been to that many black tie dinners… maybe they’re just something you acquire in a silly place like Cambridge? We’ll never know. (On that note, anyone need an over-sized dress shirt? Let me know – I’ve got some spare!). I was told firmly that ‘3 was not enough’ (has been so far!), but what could I do about it when walking and speaking were proving challenging? I will make do.</p>

<p>To London! On the bike, wobbled unsteadily under unfeasible heavy weight of unfeasibly large backpack, to the station, to London.</p>

<p>So why all this trouble? What has possessed me to collect up my smart office wear, and head into this terrifying metropolis? Science. And politics. Sciopolics? No.</p>

<p>I’m off to start a 3 month ‘policy internship’ with the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/">POST office</a>… no joke. There’s also one called ‘<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-office-for-science">GO Science</a>‘. I hope responsibility for that name can be assigned to a committee, rather than one unfortunate soul). During this internship, I’m told I will produce a four page briefing document, which will be available to the houses of Commons and Lords, on the science behind a ‘policy relevant issue’.  Four pages. In three months. Having just written a mite under 250 pages of science over four months, I find this whole idea rather baffling… but more on that later.</p>

<p>After a luxurious nights sleep in my friend’s well-appointed Brixton Maisonnette(, darling), I got on my bike, ready for my first London adventure: The Commute. Cycling in London is a strange thing. A friends described it as “… great fun! It’s like playing a computer game… but with your life… Hmm…”. You can be happily zooming along an empty side street, then meet a main road with wall-to-wall traffic, lycra-clad, virulent-yellow cyclists zipping amongst them at too-high speed. Panic! Work out a way to join the zipping cyclists without killing them, or yourself, and begin to zip yourself.  It gets rather fun after that – it’s like being in the Tour de France, but with added moving-wheely-death-crushing obstacles. You often get caught in the middle of a pack of 20-40 determinedly pedalling lycra’ed apparitions. At this stage you have two choices: (1) panic, slam breaks on, cause mass pile up, everyone run over by the bus that is nudging at your rear wheel. Or (2) pretend you’re in a murmuration. Synchronise watches, breathing, pedalling; copy everyone around you exactly, and become one with the lycra locomotive. Then you just hope REALLY hard they’re going the same way as you. Turning is a big ‘No’. Generally, I have tended towards the second option, and so far so good! I haven’t ended up in Canary Wharf wondering why I can’t see Big Ben. So in conclusion: commuting on a bike in London is great, if you don’t think about it too hard. It’s much faster than the tube (vis my 20 mins, compared to my office mates 2.5 hrs the other day), and you even get some exercise.</p>

<p>Having survived the commute, I arrived at Westminster, an hour early, to find a beautiful morning, a coffee shop, and a seat overlooking the Thames, houses of parliament lit up in the morning light. I had definitely arrived. When the time came to go to work, I found my way to No 7 Millbank. A large, unnatractive lump of a building just South West of parliament, full of various departments. Orientation: I was shown around the building (many identical corridors, literally no idea where I was going or where I had been), taken over to Parliament to get my security pass (failure… back again tomorrow!), shown to my desk, attempted to login to my computer (failure! ongoing IT woes), and am given my topic: ‘reducing diffuse water pollution from agriculture’.</p>

<p>A little outside the realms of plankton shells, but I grew up on a farm, it involves water, and I have vague recollections of biology lectures about eutrophication… so I think I should be OK. But why do we care, do you ask? From an obvious point of view, clean water is essential to everything that lives, including us, and we are busily going about polluting and mis-managing it. From a political point of view, it’s because of something called the Water Frameworks Directive, which we made law in the UK back in 2011. This is an ambitious EU plan to make sure that Europe has clean, fresh water for the foreseeable future. Good. Given the intractable links between the condition of waterways (streams, rivers, lakes, canals etc.) and the ‘health’ of the natural environment, this plan essentially focusses on restoring all the waterways in the EU to ‘good’ ecological status. Generally speaking, a healthy environment helps keep water clean, and clean water helps maintain a healthy environment. A nice cycle. However, in 2008, 80% of waterways in the UK failed to meet the ‘good’ ecological criteria set out by the EU. Poor pollution management in cities, and bad practices in farming have led to a gradual degradation of waterways in the UK, to the point where they’re in a pretty bad state. We have a big job to do! My role in this is to distill the myriad scientific studies on water pollution from agriculture, and the best ways of preventing it, down to an understandable, interesting and useful 4 page document. This will involve (a lot of) reading, conferences, interviewing experts from all industry, government, NGOs, and eventually trying to distill it into something that an MP or Lord might want to read with their morning coffee.</p>

<p>There will be plenty more about what I’m actually working on to follow, so for now I’m going to tell you a bit about my week in Westminster. Highlights so far have been: getting on to the roof of Parliament (there are tables and chairs up there!), having a security pass that lets me go in and out as I please, eating delicious food in the insanely subsidised cafes everywhere (thank you tax payers!), and sitting in on the Commons and the Lords to see what they had to say.</p>

<p>The Commons was exactly like on TV, but worse. Braying (think herd of terrible, snorting and stamping sheep), bickering, point scoring, openly having conversations with each other and not listening to the person speaking… just generally rude, and rather disappointing. I’m reasonably sure a class of school children wouldn’t be allowed to behave like that. Nevertheless, some of the people said some interesting things… but then no-one ever actually debated anything. It was more like: ‘I think this’, ‘Well I think this, so there, and also your party is rubbish’, ‘Well I think you’re both wrong, and that the EU is evil’. No-one seemed to really address the concerns raised by others, or actually listen to each other. Maybe this all happens in back rooms, and the actual house is just an elaborate strutting ground, where MPs can fluff their feathers for the electorate and try and get a few votes? I hope so.</p>

<p>The Lords impressed and surprised me. They sat quietly (admittedly, some of them might just have been asleep, or wondering why the bus was taking such a bloody long time to arrive… a couple looked like they weren’t sure where they were.), they listened, they actually had a reasoned discussion, and numerous people with different party affiliations all agreed on something (that water was something too important to politicise)! There was no braying, bleating, stamping, overt point-scoring, or general unpleasantness. There were definitely party-political undercurrents, but it was treated more as a nuisance, than the core of the debate, as it appeared in the Commons. In a way, this frustrated me: the people we elected to run the country left me feeling disappointed, confused and slightly greasy, while the entrenched peers who were there ‘just ‘cos’ managed to do what appeared to be a decent job. People took an interest, spoke intelligently,debated points, and were just… well… better!  I will go back as often as possible, and see whether this impression evolves.</p>

<p>I feel this is getting rather too long, so I will end it on a high point: The Shard. I decided on arrival, it would be a good idea to get an overview of my new shambling-grounds. So on monday night, fresh from my commute, I met with some folks, and up we went. To one of the bars on the 32nd floor, not the whole way up – we decided we would rather pay for a cocktail than a lift. The lift was fun. The numbers of the first ten floors seemed to vanish in about 2 seconds flat. ZOOM! But I felt rather silly about the whole thing – extravagant, ridiculous, it’s going to be disappointing.  All thoughts running through my head.  It was great. Excellent cocktails, stunning view, just generally a fantastic introduction to city life.</p>

<p>A week later, I’m still alive, I have resisted the urge to leave london, and am really enjoying myself. Cycling everywhere helps – before this I had essentially thought of london as a series of tube stations, separated by vast oceans of larva, or some other insurmountable barrier. Little isolated patches of chaos, focussed around an underground station – maybe you can see why it terrified me so? Things are much better on a bike. Places join up and make sense, and the whole place is less intimidating. Still enormous and terrifying, but in a manageable way.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to more.</p>
